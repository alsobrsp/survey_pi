This is a fork of the Nohal survey_pi plugin.

Contains a Windows compiled version of the plugin for use with OpenCPN 4.0.0. Also the necessary dll to run the program as 
set out below. 

There is a Hydromagic format file to use with the Import facility. 

'Read NMEA File' reads the sentences from an OpenCPN VDR plugin text file. I created an .exe to produce NMEA sentences
from a Garmin "ACTIVE_LOG" file, with depths (Not included). Rausch.txt is included, to allow work with NMEA sentences.

Problem: With the plugin installed OpenCPN crashes when O is closed. 

Original README notes from Nohal:
Survey plugin for OpenCPN
=========================

Dependencies: libgeos-dev, libfreexl-dev

Uses the excellent Spatialite library from http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/
To browse and organize your data, get https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gui/index and/or https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gis/index

On Windows you need iconv.dll somewhere in your PATH or in OpenCPN's program directory. Get it from https://github.com/downloads/nohal/survey_pi/iconv.dll

To compile on Windows you need iconv - The easiest to get it is to use OSGeo4W - described a bit more in the note below.

Note
====

If, in the future, we will want to get all the functionality from spatialite

Compilation on Linux
sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev libproj-dev libfreexl-dev

Compilation on Windows:
Get OSGeo4Win: http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/
Install the following libraries: proj.4, freexl, geos, iconv
If you don't like the default location C:\OSGeo4W, you will have to modify CMakeLists.txt

Usage on Windows
Copy the following DLLs to the OpenCPN program folder: freexl.dll, geos_c.dll, proj.dll, iconv.dll - They can be found in the bin subfolder of your OSGeo4W instalation
